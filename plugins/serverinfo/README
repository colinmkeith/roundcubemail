About
================

Plugin that displays some basic server info. It is also possible to
add custom fields and use dynamic variables.

Main focus is server names, port numbers and capabilities, to make it
easier for the users to configure their third party mail clients.

Possible future versions will be posted to:

Install
================

* Place plugin folder into plugins directory of Roundcube
* Enable the plugin by adding it to the Roundcube configuration file 
  Example: 
     $rcmail_config['plugins'] = array("serverinfo", "otherplugin")

Configuration 
================

The default configuration works out of the box, but some information
fields will probably be wrong, and you need to edit the configuration:

* Copy config.inc.php.dist to config.inc.php in the plugin folder
  It is recommended to keep the dist file.
* Open config.inc.php and edit the configuration to best reflect your
  server.
* If you have more information you want to add, you can put it in custom
  fields in some of the categories in the Server Information box, or
  enable the custom bottom box. If including a file box, make sure to use
  your own file name instead of editing the example file directly, to
  avoid your customized file being overwritten on plugin upgrade.
